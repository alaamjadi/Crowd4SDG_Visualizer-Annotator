## Instructions

#### Using the application

1) From the right side menu, choose the "New Question" item. Insert the question and possible answers (use a semicolon to separate answers.

Submitting this at any stage will reset the app (same as refreshing the page) and everything will be cleared.

3) Select the proper answers for each picture. By navigating between different pages your progress will not get cleared.

4) When you are done with all the pictures for one CSV file, you can download the results output CSV file by clicking on the submit button.

5) You can repeat steps two to four for each input CSV file for the same question.

- The output CSV file name would be "QUESTION - INPUT_CSV_FILENAME.csv".
- The loading of images for each page might take 2-5 seconds to load, please be patient.
- This app has been tested for CSV files with 10K entries without any problem. Please report any possible bugs and issues you may face.
